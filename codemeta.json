    "name": "SolTrack: Compute the position of the Sun in topocentric coordinates",
    "description": "SolTrack computes the position of the Sun, the rise and set times and azimuths, and transit times and altitudes. It includes corrections for aberration and parallax, and has a simple routine to correct for atmospheric refraction, taking into account local atmospheric conditions. SolTrack is derived from the Fortran library libTheSky (ascl:2209.018) and has versions in C(++), Arduino Scratch and Python. The package can be used to track the Sun on a low-specs machine, such as a microcontroller or PLC, and can be used for (highly) concentrated (photovoltaic) solar power or accurate solar-energy modeling.",

SolTrack INSTALL
soltrack.sf.net



DEPENDENCIES:

SolTrack is written in plain C, hence you will need a C compiler.  Gcc is a 
free, open-source C/C++ compiler included in many GNU/Linux 
distributions and available from https://gcc.gnu.org/.  

The default installer uses CMake to configure and compile the code.  CMake is also 
open-source software, also included in most GNU/Linux distributions, and can be 
downloaded from http://www.cmake.org/.  Alternatively, you can create your own 
Makefile or compile and link the code manually.



UNPACKING:

After downloading from soltrack.sf.net, you can unpack the tarball and cd into its 
directory by doing e.g.:

  $ tar xfz soltrack-0.1.tar.gz
  $ cd soltrack-0.1/

(replace "0.1" with the correct version number).



CONFIGURING, COMPILING AND INSTALLING:

To configure, compile and install the code and data files (in the CMake (not Linux! -
see below) default system directories /usr/local/...), from the main package directory 
(the one that contains the file CMakeLists.txt), do:

 $ mkdir build && cd build/
 $ cmake ..
 $ make
 $ sudo make install

The second step above configures the code and should find your C compiler.  
The third step compiles and links the code, and the last step installs it 
on your system - for which you need root priveliges, hence the 'sudo' command.


To install the package in a specific system directory, e.g. the Linux default /usr/...
(RECOMMENDED), do:

 $ mkdir build && cd build/
 $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/usr ..
 $ make
 $ sudo make install


To install the package in your own user directory, you won't need root priveliges,
can omit the 'sudo' command and combine the last two commands, e.g.:

 $ mkdir build && cd build/
 $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/home/me/usr ..
 $ make install


To compile the code without installing it anywhere, leave out the install step
 
 $ mkdir build && cd build/
 $ cmake ..
 $ make

The compiled libraries and modules can then be found in the usr/ subdirectory of the
package dir.


On a Linux system, the library and module files could be installed as:
/usr/lib/libSolTrack.*
/usr/include/SolTrack.h


To compile the code with your favourite compiler (in case you have several installed),
prepend the cmake line with e.g. CC=gcc:

 $ CC=gcc cmake ..


If you have multiple cores or processors, you can speed up the make step by specifying
the number of parallel build jobs using the -j option.  E.g., for four cores, you can
have four parallel jobs and use:

 $ make -j4
